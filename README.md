## General info
In my learningJS series here on Git Hub I will showcase simple applications built mostly as a practice while learning JavaScript. Number Guessing Game lets you define difficulty and range of numbers in which you play the game. Higher difficulty reduces number of guesses per game. Goal is to guess which number browser calculated in defined range.
